# OSC-kreuz

The osc-kreuz serves as a central interface for OSC messages in a multiclient spatial rendering environment. It automatically translates incoming OSC messages to match the expected formats of the rendering engines and distributes it to all connected clients including UI Clients and Data clients for automation data.


# About

The osc-kreuz was originally developed as part of the SeamLess Suite, then named OSC-Router.
